## About

This plugin is useful if you want to easily query Logstash data on *day of week*, *hour of day*, or other parts of a date.  See the usage below for details on the output of the plugin.  The date parts that can be generated are:

* day
* wday
* mday
* yday
* month
* year
* hour
* min
* sec

## Documentation

### Installation

To manually install the plugin, download the gem and run:

`bin/plugin install --no-verify logstash-filter-dateparts-1.0.0.gem`

### Usage

To see the most basic usage, you can run the following (on Linux):

`echo "HI" | bin/logstash -e 'input { stdin {} } filter {dateparts { }} output { stdout { codec=> rubydebug}}'`

You could also use the logstash generator:

`bin/logstash -e 'input {  generator { lines => ["HI"] count => 1  } } filter {dateparts { }} output { stdout { codec=> rubydebug}}'`

Here is the sample output:

	{
		"message" => "HI",
		"@version" => "1",
		"@timestamp" => "2015-11-20T12:24:40.217Z",
		"host" => "mike-VirtualBox",
		"day" => 20,
		"wday" => 5,
		"yday" => 324,
		"month" => 11,
		"year" => 2015,
		"hour" => 12,
		"min" => 24,
		"sec" => 40
	}


This uses the default configuration, which generates the following fields from the `@timestamp` field of the event:

* day
* wday
* yday
* month
* year
* hour
* min
* sec

### Configuration

#### Fields

The generated fields are based on the date functions available in the [Ruby time class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Time.html).  You can specify any valid function and it will be added to the event.

For example, this will add 2 fields, *sec* corresponding to `time.sec()` and *hour* corresponding to `time.hour()`:

    filter {
    	   dateparts {
	   	     "fields" => ["sec", "hour"]
	   }
    }

#### Time Field

By default, the plugin will use the *@timestamp* field, but you can specify a different one:

    filter {
    	   dateparts {
	   	     "time_field" => "some_other_field"
	   }
    }

#### Duration Field (new in 2.1)

2.1 provides the ability to calculate a duration (in seconds.milliseconds) based on 2 field.s
The value of the duration is a float with millisecond precision.

The input values must both be time values, and you specify an output field for the result

    filter {
         'fields' => %w(mday),
         'duration' => {
             'start_field' => 'tstart',
             'end_field' => 'tend',
             'result_field' => 'duration'
         }
     }

#### Error Tags

By default, the tag *_dateparts_error* is added on exception.  You can specify different tag(s) like so:

    filter {
    	   dateparts {
	   	     "error_tags" => ["bad_dates", "xyz"]
	   }
    }
